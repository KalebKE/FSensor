## Acceleration Sensor

[Acceleration Sensor Useage](/documentation/ACCELERATION_SENSOR.md) -> A simple, uncalibrated estimation of the devices acceleration.

## Linear Acceleration Sensor

[Linear Acceleration Sensor Useage](/documentation/LINEAR_ACCELERATION_SENSOR.md) -> A simple estimation of the devices linear acceleration provided by Android.

## Low Pass Linear Acceleration Sensor

[Low Pass Linear Acceleration Sensor Useage](/documentation/LOW_PASS_LINEAR_ACCELERATION_SENSOR.md) -> A simple estimation of the devices linear acceleration based on a low-pass filter.

## Complementary Linear Acceleration

[Complementary Linear Acceleratoin Sensor Useage](/documentation/COMPLEMENTARY_LINEAR_ACCELERATION_SENSOR.md) -> A calibrated, sensor fusion backed estimation of the devices orientation. Uses a complementary filter in conjunction with the acceleration, magnetic and gyroscope sensors.

## Kalman Linear Acceleration Sensor

[Kalman Linear Acceleration Sensor Useage](/documentation/KALMAN_LINEAR_ACCELERATION_SENSOR.md) -> A calibrated, sensor fusion backed estimation of the devices orientation. Uses a Kalman filter in conjunction with the acceleration, magnetic and gyroscope sensors.
