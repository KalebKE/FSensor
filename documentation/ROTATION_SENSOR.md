## Gyroscope Sensor

[Gyroscope Sensor Useage](/documentation/GYROSCOPE_SENSOR.md) -> A simple, uncalibrated estimation of the devices orientation.

## Complementary Gyroscope Sensor

[Complementary Gyroscope Sensor Useage](/documentation/COMPLIMENTARY_GYROSCOPE_SENSOR.md.md) -> A calibrated, sensor fusion backed estimation of the devices orientation. Uses a complementary filter in conjunction with the acceleration, magnetic and gyroscope sensors.

## Kalman Gyroscope Sensor

[Gyroscope Sensor Useage](/documentation/KALMAN_GYROSCOPE_SENSOR.md) -> A calibrated, sensor fusion backed estimation of the devices orientation. Uses a Kalman filter in conjunction with the acceleration, magnetic and gyroscope sensors.
